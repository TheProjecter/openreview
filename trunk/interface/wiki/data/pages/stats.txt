====== Help with Postgenomic statistics and rankings ======

Rankings are a subjective affair: bear in mind that the makeup of science blogs isn't necessarily the same as the makeup of scientists as a whole (or even science blog readers as a whole).

==== Blogs ====

All blog statistics are calculated over a 90 day window.

Blogs are ranked on the number of incoming links from other science blogs (in posts; not as part of the blogroll).

Word counts, % complexity, Flesch, Kincaid and Fog readability statistics are calculated by looking at the posts from each feed that we have in the database. Blogs that don't include the full text of their posts in their feeds won't have accurate stats (they won't influence the rankings of other blogs or paper / link citations as much, either). There's a page about making your blog [[Postgenomic friendly]] elsewhere on the wiki.

Statistics are calculated once a week (it's an in-depth process!). If you've had some really popular posts over the past couple of days then don't despair if your ranking doesn't change immediately.

==== Journals ====

Journals are ranked on the number of posts from science blogs that link to one or more of their papers - **not** on the number of papers in the index. 

If you see a line saying that there are "no direct links" to papers on a journal summary page then it's possible that we aren't picking up papers from that journal properly: this is because Postgenomic only follows links that lead to the URLs we know are associated with journals. The solution is for the relevant publisher to send us a list of relevant URLs / journal names.
