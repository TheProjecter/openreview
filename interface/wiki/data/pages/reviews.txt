====== Reviews ======

===== What =====

Reviews on Postgenomic are like mini-reviews of single papers. Imagine that you are making a presentation to a (very large) journal club. Reviews can be positive or negative or anywhere in-between and can be as formal or informal as you like. Reviews typically carry a rating.

Reviews can be created by bloggers and registered users. They are lightly curated by NPG to ensure that they meet some minimum standards for inclusion:

  * They should cover one paper in detail
  * They should be at least ~100 words long, not including any text quoted from the paper
  * No defamatory or grossly offensive material, please

===== Why =====

What are the benefits?

Reviews are:

  * given a DOI so that they can be cited easily
  * version controlled (we'll have a backed-up digital record of them for as long as you want us to)
  * added as a LinkOut to the relevant paper in PubMed 
  * A great way to share specialized knowledge with a wider scientific audience

===== How =====

Any registered user can add a review to a paper.

Or you can use semantic markup in your blog posts.
